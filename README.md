## Project

**FOCUS** = Predicting rainfall patterns using historical data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded dataset (2000-present).

**DATA SOURCE** = Daily rainfall and temperature observations from 300 locations across India from Jan 2000 to Dec 2023.

**GOAL** = Develop a predictive model for accurate rainfall forecasting.

**APPROACHES** = Use multiple machine learning models:

    - Linear regression model

    - SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

    - Hybrid deep learning model using CNN and LSTM.

**METHODOLOGY** = Train and evaluate each model on the dataset.

Performance analysis done using following evaluation metrics:

    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

    - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

    - R-squared

**POSSIBLE USE CASES** = Identify the most effective model for rainfall prediction, which can be later used for:

    - Water resource management

    - Agricultural planning
    
    - Disaster mitigation


## GIT HUB STRUCTURE

**Data** Folder = Contains the RAW, Interim and Processed Dataset.

RAW Data was not copied to GITHUB, due to large size of the files.

**Notebooks** Folder = Contains the jupyter notebooks used for data processing, and various modelling approaches.

**Models** Folder = Contains the various trained model, which can be used for rainfall prediction.

**Reportss** Folder = Contains for the images of plots.
